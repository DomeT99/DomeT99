💻 I'm a great computer science lover, everything about it arouses extreme curiosity in me.

💣 I don't get discouraged when there's a problem to solve: new problem, new challenge, new skills. This also allows me to experiment with new solutions.




💎 I like to experiment with new languages ​​and new frameworks, to achieve the goal, which is to specialize in a certain area with certain technologies.


I also contributed to the:

✔️ [Oruga](https://github.com/oruga-ui/oruga)
